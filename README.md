# Supercollider-Timewave_Synthesizer
This synthesizer was developed based upon the Timewave theory, by Terence McKenna. His theory is that time is a complex wave, and the King Wen sequence of the I Ching is a 64 hexagram model from which the timewave is derived; that the King Wen sequence maps the linear progression of the human states of mind - which ultimately substantiates the timewave. This theory is the basis for the well-known novelty computer program he and others had developed.
