# Timewave Synthesizer
This synthesizer is derived from and based upon Terence McKenna's Timewave theory. Timewave theory proposes that time is a complex wave, and the King Wen sequence of the I Ching is a 64 hexagram model from which the timewave is derived; that the King Wen sequence maps the linear progression of the human states of mind - which ultimately substantiates the timewave. This theory is the basis for the well-known novelty computer program he and others had developed. 

The seven-stringed synthesizer can be found in the "timewavesynth7" files. 

The three-stringed synthesizer can be found in the "timewavesynth3" files.

Simply evaluate the file in Supercollider IDE to run the synthesizer. Instructions can be found at the top of the file.
