# Timewave Synthesizer
This synthesizer was developed based upon the Timewave theory, by Terence McKenna. His theory is that time is a complex wave, and the King Wen sequence of the I Ching is a 64 hexagram model from which this complex wave is derived; that the King Wen sequence maps the linear progression of the human states of mind, which ultimately substantiates the timewave. This theory is the basis for the well-known novelty computer program he and others had developed. 

How to run:

- Choose the 8-stringed synthesizer ("timewavesynthi8.scd" or "timewavesynthi8osx.scd"), and program songs using the "timewavesynth8 script.scd" file.

- Evaluate the file in Supercollider IDE to run the synthesizer. Instructions can be found at the top of the file.
