# Timewave Synthesizer
This synthesizer is derived from and based upon Terence McKenna's Timewave Zero theory. His theory is that time is a complex wave, and the King Wen sequence of the I Ching is a 64 hexagram model from which this complex wave is derived; that the King Wen sequence maps the linear progression of the human states of mind, which ultimately substantiates the timewave. This theory is the basis for the well-known novelty computer program he and others had developed. 

How to run:

- Choose the 8-stringed synthesizer ("timewavesynth8.scd" or "timewavesynth8osx.scd") or the 12-stringed synthesizer ("timewavesynth12.scd" or "timewavesynth12osx.scd"), and program/make songs using the "timewavesynth8script.scd" or "timewavesynth12script.scd" file.

- Evaluate the file in Supercollider IDE to run the synthesizer. Instructions can be found at the top of the file.
